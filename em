Hi Ken,

I've attached the two completed WP docs converted from SOPs.

There are 2 points I would like to clarify:

1. WP File Naming: I wasn't sure about the naming conventions, so I used titles based on the core content of each SOP. I hope they are intuitive and clear enough for you.

2. In the WP documents, I've filled in the target audience section, but I'm uncertain about the specific functions corresponding to each role. The content I've provided may need further clarification and modification.

Please let me know if there are any other modifications needed.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
