To solve your PowerBI matrix issue with blank cells not accepting background color, you'll need to use a DAX measure to replace blank values. Since you're working with text values, here's how to approach it:

1. Create a new measure that checks if your current value exists and replaces blanks with a placeholder value:

```
DisplayValue = 
VAR CurrentValue = [YourExistingMeasure]
RETURN
    IF(
        ISBLANK(CurrentValue),
        "No Data",  // Replace with your preferred placeholder text
        CurrentValue
    )
```

2. Use this new measure in your matrix instead of your original measure.

3. Now you can apply conditional formatting to all cells since none will be truly blank.

For your specific country-based formatting, you can create a separate measure for the formatting condition:

```
BackgroundCondition = 
IF(
    SELECTEDVALUE(TableName[Country]) = "YourTargetCountry",
    1,
    0
)
```

Then use this measure for your background color conditional formatting rules.

Would you like me to explain any part of this solution in more detail?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
