I understand why the solution didn't work. The problem is that in a matrix, when data doesn't exist for certain combinations of dimensions (like specific country+month+ID combinations), PowerBI doesn't even evaluate the measure for those cells - they're structurally blank rather than containing blank values.

Here's a more effective approach:

1. Create a new calculated column in your data table instead of a measure:

```
DisplayColumn = 
IF(
    ISBLANK([YourValueColumn]),
    "No Data",
    [YourValueColumn]
)
```

2. Alternatively, if you must use a measure, try this version which forces evaluation across all combinations:

```
DisplayValue = 
VAR CurrentValue = MAX([YourValueColumn])
RETURN
    IF(
        ISBLANK(CurrentValue) || CurrentValue = "",
        "No Data",
        CurrentValue
    )
```

3. You might also need to modify your matrix to show "empty" cells:
   - Click on your matrix
   - Go to Format pane > Values
   - Turn on "Show items with no data"

This should ensure all cells have a value and can accept background color formatting. Would you like me to suggest other approaches if this doesn't resolve the issue?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
